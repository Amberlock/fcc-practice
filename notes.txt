This folder is for keeping some html files copy-pasted from free code camp tutorials.
Going to try to use the git workflow we learned earlier this year with every session, so that we don't forget and have to re-learn it repeatedly!

Maybe later: try to get the html files readable on the actual internet, using the odin project thing pre-fab rails app we learned earlier?
